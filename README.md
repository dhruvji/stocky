# stocky
The goal of this project was creating a calculator to help with analysing how diversified one's stock portfolio is. Having the correlation of a stock compared to another calculated helps with decision making such as if adding the stock in a long term portfolio makes sense. The data also displays on a heat map if one wants to compare their entire portfolio. 

Uses Yahoo Finance API for the stock data, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Used some youtube resources and the documentation for matplotlib graphing and creation of the csv's.
